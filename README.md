# Land-Use-Land-Cover-(LULC)-Classification-Using-Landsat-7-Multispectral-Satellite-Images
Detection of LULC types such as buildings, vegetation, water bodies etc. with the use of Landsat 7 multi-spectral satellite images. Landsat images are become valuable as well as free resource as it provides the factors like high resolution, temporal distribution and availability for the detection of LULC. Further, use of QGIS tool helps to explore and object-based image classification. Thus, classification will help to detection the covered region for a particular LULC type. Thus, continuous monitoring over the same area will give the difference of LULC resulting in rapid or slower growth of land use land cover region.
